# Nexus Agency Website

A fully completed, modern agency website built using **pure HTML and CSS**.  
This project was intentionally developed without JavaScript to deeply focus on layout architecture, responsiveness, animations, and clean UI design principles.

It represents a finished portfolio piece and reflects real-world frontend development practices used in professional marketing and agency websites.
